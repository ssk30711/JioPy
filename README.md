Jio TV - Python Server   
*Watch TV ~right from your laptop!~ anywhere on your home network!*

### Requirements:
- Python 3.X
- Internet Access
- A Jio Account

### Features
- Easy Login (Username and Password).
- Web app to stream from a browser.
- M3U8 Playlist for importing into your favorite Streaming App.
- Current Show (EPG) (whenever possible).
- Accessible anywhere on your network!

### Known Issues:
- Channel Stream doesn't load at times. [FIXED]
    - restarting the server or reload solves most of the time
- Very Basic UI
- Script lacks login using OTP and persistant sessions.


### Future work:
- Adding EPG to UI and Backend
- Enhancing UI
- Improving Flask routes
- Support for navigation from TV Devices (Remotes) (I really hope this works!)

PS. I began working on this project to get Jio TV working on my fireTV. 
Starting this server on my computer allows me to access this anywhere on my network. 
Unfortunately at the moment this site isn't remote friendly :(
