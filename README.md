# Jio-PyServer

Jio TV - Python Server   
*Watch TV right from your laptop!*

### Requirements:
- Python 3.X
- Internet Access
- A Jio Account

### Known Issues:
- Channel Stream doesn't load at times.
    - restarting the server or reload solves most of the time
- UI is pretty basic


### Future work:
- Adding EPG to UI and Backend
- Enhancing UI
- Support for navigation from TV Devices (I really hope this works!)

`PS. I began working on this project to get Jio TV working on my fireTV. Starting this server on my computer allows me to access this anywhere on my network. Unfortunately at the moment this site isn't remote friendly :(
